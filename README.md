## 🕹️ How to Play
1.  **Start:** Click the Green Flag 🏁 to start the game.
2.  **Controls:** Use the **Left** and **Right** arrow keys (⬅️ ➡️) to move the monkey.

## 💡 Logic & Concepts Used
* **Event Listeners:** Handling keyboard inputs for movement.
* **Looping:** Continuous falling motion of the bananas.
* **Conditionals (If-Statements):** Checking if the banana touches the monkey (Score +1) or the ground (Game Over).
* **Randomization:** Bananas appear at random X-positions.
* **Variables:** Tracking the `Score`.
